# sshwitch SSH Switch
Login and run commands on your network devices via an ssh connection on a remote server. Easy to use PHP static class methods with static chaining support for rapid development.  Supports Cisco and Juniper network routers and switches with more easily added.

We handle the switch login and elevation using [rancid](https://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) and it supports more than what I've adde so far. It would take only a few lines of code to add support to login to devices from Extreme Networks, Juniper, Procket Networks, Redback, A10, Alteon, Avocent (Cyclades), Bay Networks (Nortel), ADC-kentrox, Foundry, HP, Hitachi, Juniper Networks, MRV, Mikrotik, Netscreen, Nokia (Alcatel-Lucent), Netscaler, Riverstone, Netopia, Xirrus, and Arrcus.
